Things to improve:

Remove hall sensor functionality
Add can bus or smth, since i2c is not robust
Add pull down resistor for enable pin of vid 6606, connect to MCU pin
Change microcontroller to smth cheaper/newer (RP2040?)?
Add bus daisy chain connectors
Add better connector (instead of screw terminal)
Use pin 14 instead of pin 22 (if same MapleMini is used, gave some weird issues)

Maybe switch to TMC2209 or smth for more silent driving (Some preliminary tests showed they do work with these steppers and are a bit more quiet)
