A clock consiting of 24 X40 stepper motors. There are 6 pcb where 4 of the X40 steppers are on a pcb. On each PCB 2 X40 (so 4 steppers, since X40 are dual axle) are controlled by a VID6606 stepper controller, so 2 VID6606 per PCB. These 2 are controlled by 1 MapleMini STM32F103. These 6 modules are controlled by a single RasberryPi Pico running MicroPython, this Pico communicates with the modules over I2C and also a DS3231 RTC for timekeeping. Setting the time and display modes is done via a button panel of 4 buttons. The PiPico uses asynchronous programming.


Additional notes: 
- The bus should be switched to CAN something else more robust then I2C, which is used here. I2C works flawlessly for me but perhaps in a higher noise environment errors would occur.
- there was a plan to automatically zero the steppers with a small magnet and hall sensor but this was not implemented, but the sensor mountings are present on the PCB
- I lubricated the X40 steppers with SuperLube which did definitely reduce noise.
- The main body is made of Korian which i had made by a professional using the drawing in the 3d parts folder
